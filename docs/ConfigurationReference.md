This page describes the means we have to customize the reprepro-bundle-tools
and the resulting dynamic reprepro configuration to your own needs.

There are currently the following kinds of configuration mechanisms that can be
used:

* [Templates](#templates) for the
  * [`bundle`-tool](#templates-for-the-bundle-tool)
  * [`bundle-compose`-tool](#templates-for-the-bundle-compose-tool)
* [The apt-repos configuration in `.apt-repos`](#the-apt-repos-configuration-in-apt-repos) to define
  * [default supplier-suites for `bundle edit`](#defining-default-supplier-suites-for-bundle-edit)
  * [bundle repositories for `bundle` and `bundle-compose`](#defining-bundle-repositories-for-bundle-and-bundle-compose)
  * [bundle-base suites for `bundle-compose` and reference suites for `bundle`](#defining-bundle-base-suites-for-bundle-compose-and-reference-suites-for-bundle)
  * [target suites for `bundle-compose apply`](#defining-target-suites-for-bundle-compose-apply)
* [Project specific "Point"-Files](#project-specific-point-files) for the
  * [`bundle`-tool](#point-files-for-the-bundle-tool)
  * [`bundle-compose`-tool](#point-files-for-the-bundle-compose-tool)
* [Global Config Files for the `bundle-compose-app`](#global-config-files-for-the-bundle-compose-app)


In the chapter [Minimal Setup](../README.md#minimal-setup) we created a basic
configuration just by copying an existing configuration from the folder
reprepro-bundle-tools/test into our own "reprepro-management" project:

    cp -a reprepro-bundle-tools/test/.apt-repos/ reprepro-bundle-tools/test/templates/ .

To run the reprepro-bundle-tools, you always need a project directory that
contains at least a folder `templates` and a folder `.apt-repos`. Let's have
a look at these folders:


Templates
=========


Templates for the `bundle`-tool
-------------------------------

The folder `templates/bundle/{distribution}` contains templates needed
for the `bundle`-tool to run and to create config files for the bundle's config-folders
`repo/bundle/{targetDistribution}/{bundleNumber}/conf` (where `{targetDistribution}` is
your distribution and `{bundleNumber}` is the 5 digit number of a bundle
created with the `bundle`-tool; If you are managing multiple distributions, you would probarbly need more than one
`{targetDistribution}` folder there).

Please refer to `man reprepro` for a detailled description of the configuration
files for reprepro. This knowledge is required in order to understand the details
of these config settings.

Each template files from this folder is processed by the `bundle` tool using the
jinja2 template engine. This way it is possible to provide great flexibility
for customizations. The jinja2 template language allows to use variables, expressions,
basic control structures and much more. Please have a look at the
[Jinja Template Designer Documentation](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/templates/) for more details.

The following variables are automatically set by the `bundle` tool and can be used
within a template:

* ***creator***:  This is the unix user name of the person running the `bundle` tool
                  as returned by the python call `getpass.getuser()`.
* ***release***:  This is the name of the (target) release this bundle is created for.
                  In contrast to `bundleName` this contains just the release name
                  e.g. `mybionic` and not the bundle number.
* ***readOnly***: This variable by default contains "No". Only if a bundle is sealed,
                  This variable is put to "Yes"
* ***bundleName***: This variable contains the bundle name consisting of
                  `{targetDistribution}/{bundleNumber}`.
* ***baseBundleName***: This variable contains the name of the bundle this bundle is
                  cloned of or "NEW" if the bundle is not cloned from another bundle.
* ***updateRules***: This variable contains the names of the update-Rules created in
                  the updates template. This value is typically meant to be used
                  within the `Update:`-rule of a `distributions` file.

The template engine also distinguishes the following different suffixes of template file names:

* ***{name}.once***: The resulting file `{name}` is only created if it is not already
                 existing. This is usefull to mark a template file to not override
                 an existing file in the bundle's conf directory.
* ***{name}.skel***: This template defines a snippet of lines (a section) that is
                 typically repeated within the resulting file `{name}`.


### distributions

This is the template for `distributions` file created for each bundle. The
`distributions` file is adjusted with each `bundle init`, `bundle clone` and
`bundle edit` call. It typically defines the keywords also contained in this example:

    Origin: MyOwnDistri
    Label: {{ bundleName }}
    Suite: {{ bundleName }}
    Codename: mybionic
    Version: …
    Description: …
    Architectures: i386 amd64 source
    Components: main restricted universe multiverse partner
    UDebComponents: main restricted universe multiverse partner
    Contents: .gz .bz2
    UDebIndices: Packages Release . .gz
    Tracking: minimal
    ReadOnly: {{ readOnly }}
    Update: - {{ updateRules }}


### info.once

This is the template for the `info`-file, a bundle-tool specific file that holds
metadata about the bundle and a Releasenotes section to store information for
latter custom usage. This is an example:

    Bundlename: {{ bundleName }}
    BasedOn: {{ baseBundleName }}
    Distribution: {{ release }}
    Rollout: false
    Target: standard
    Creator: {{ creator }}
    Releasenotes: <Subject>
     .
     <Details>
     .
     __DYNAMIC_PACKAGE_LIST__
     .


### sources_control.list.once

This file is just there to ensure that there's a `sources_control.list` file in
the bundle's conf folder. This list file is also bundle-tool specific and contains
the list of bundles selected by `bundle edit`. Initially this file is empty.


### updates.skel

This skeleton contains the definition of the update-rules generated into
the bundle's updates-file. For each supplier suite (set in `bundle edit`)
an update rule is generated referring to the supplier suite and defining
the relevant information such as Components, Architectures and the list of
Packages we want to use from that supplier suite. The supplier suite specific
information is read from the apt-repos configuration of the supplier-suite
defined in the `.apt-repos` folder (see below). If needed, please find a reference of
apt-repos specific keywords in
[the apt-repos Configuration.md document](https://github.com/lhm-limux/apt-repos/blob/master/docs/Configuration.md).

`bundle edit` supplies the
following additional variables to the `updates.skel` file:

* ***ruleName***: The reprepro identifier of the update rule as also referred
                  in the above variable `updateRules`.
* ***repoUrl***: This supplier suite specific information (pointing to the
                apt-repository) of the supplier suite is read from the apt-repos
                configuration.
* ***suiteName***: The `suiteName` of the supplier suite as it is defined
                in the apt-repos configuration. If the corresponding apt-repos
                config uses `"scan": true`, the suite name could be autodetected by
                apt-repos. Note, that the suite name of the supplier suite typically
                differs from the `release` name of our own distribution.
* ***(udeb)Components***: The list of components of the supplier suites as defined in the
                apt-repos config. Components could also be autodetected using
                `"scan": true` in the apt-repos config.
* ***architectures***: The list of architectures supported by the supplier suite. These
                values could also be autodetected if `"scan": true` is set in the
                apt-repos config.
* ***publicKeys***: The bundle tool is able to create a list of valid keys, reflecting
                all gpg key id's found in the `"TrustedGPG"` file configured for the
                apt-repos suite. These keys are delivered in a form useful for the
                `VerifyRelease` keyword in the update rule.
* ***filterListFile***: For each supplier suite, a FilterListFile is generated that
                defines the (source) packages `reprepro` should receive from the
                supplier suite. This variable contains the uniq name of the list file.
* ***blacklistFile***: If `bundle blacklist` is used, a blacklist file in generated and
                it's name is put into this variable.

Putting all this information together, an example for the updates.skel is:

    Name: {{ ruleName }}
    Method: {{ repoUrl }}
    Suite: {{ suiteName }}
    Components: {{ components }}
    UDebComponents:
    Architectures: {{ architectures }} source
    VerifyRelease: {{ publicKeys }}
    GetInRelease: no
    FilterSrcList: purge {{ filterListFile }}
    {%- if blacklistFile %}
    FilterList: install {{ blacklistFile }}
    {%- endif %}
    DownloadListsAs: .gz


Templates for the `bundle-compose`-tool
---------------------------------------

The folder `templates/bundle_compose/` contains templates that are evaluated by
`bundle-compose apply` for the creation of a reprepro configuration describing the
*target* repository. All generated configuration files for the target
repository can be found in `repo/target/conf`. The apt-repository itself is initially
empty. Using the command `reprepro -b repo/target update` causes reprepro to
read the configuration from `repo/target/conf` and to create an apt-repository
containing all our target-suites and their content.

Please refer to `man reprepro` for a detailed description of the configuration
files for reprepro. This knowledge is required in order to understand the details
of these config settings.

In order to create the *reprepro*-configuration, `bundle-compose apply` recursively
copies all files contained in `templates/bundle_compose/` into the target folder
`repo/target/conf` respecting the following rules for different suffixes:

* ***{name}.once***: The resulting file `{name}` is only created if it does not already
                 exist. This is useful to mark a template file to not override
                 an existing file in the target's conf directory.
* ***{name}.symlink***: In the target's conf directory a symlink named `{name}` will
                 be created, pointing to the corresponding `{name}.symlink` file in
                 the templates dir. This means that the resulting file is not a
                 copy of the origin file but just a symlink to the origin file.
                 This could be useful to avoid copies of redundant files. We used
                 this feature e.g. to define a common (and big) blacklist file.
* ****.skel***:  This template defines a snippet of lines (a section) that is
                 typically repeated within some other result file. `*.skel`-files are
                 not copied 1:1 to the target's conf directory but processed in
                 a special way described in the following sections:


### target_distributions.skel --> *distributions/bundle-compose_dynamic.conf*

This file contains the skeleton of a section in the (dynamic) result file
`repo/target/conf/distributions/bundle-compose_dynamic.conf` - *for each target suite*,
one section is added to the result file. Again, we are using the jinja2 template engine
to evaluate the skeleton (please see the
[Jinja Template Designer Documentation](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/templates/) for more details).

The list of available target suites is defined in form of an apt-repos configuration
in the `.apt-repos` folder (see below). Please note that **target suites necissaily
have to be defined in form of
[Self-Contained repo_descriptions](https://github.com/lhm-limux/apt-repos/blob/master/docs/Configuration.md#self-contained-repo_descriptions)!**
This allows us to configure the parameters for target suites even if the target suites
don't yet exist physically (this is needed for bootstrapping a target repository from
scratch).

`bundle-compose apply` reads the target suites from the apt-repos configuration and
passes these data over to the `target_distributions.skel` in form of the following
variables created for each suite:

* ***suite***: The suite name of the target suite (as defined in the apt-repos config).
* ***components***: The components defined for the suite.
* ***archtectures***: The architectures this suite will hold packages for.
* ***updates***: A list of reprepro update rule identifier describing the dynamic
                 content of the target suite (see below for details about the
                 selection of ted content of a target suite).

This is an example for a `target_distributions.skel` file using these variables:

    Origin: MyOwnDistri
    Label: {{ suite }}
    Suite: {{ suite }}
    Codename: {{ suite }}
    Description: merge target for {{ suite }}
    Architectures: {{ architectures }} source
    Components: {{ components }}
    Contents: .gz .bz2
    Update: - {{ updates }}


### bundle_updates.skel --> *updates/bundle-compose_dynamic.conf*

The skeleton `bundle_updates.skel` contains the definition of an update
rule added to the file `repo/target/conf/updates/bundle-compose_dynamic.conf`.
*For each bundle selected* for a target suite, one update rule is generated.
Again, the skeleton is evaluated as a jinja2 template.

The required information about the bundles is read from the apt-repos
configuration contained in the `.apt-repos` folder (details below).

For each bundle, the following variables are passed to the template engine:

* ***ruleName***: The reprepro identifier of the update rule as referred in the
                  variable `updates` (see target_distributions.skel)
* ***repoUrl***:  The repository URL of the bundle (read from the bundle's
                  apt-repos configuration).
* ***suite***:    The suite name of the bundle (read from the bundle's apt-repos
                  configuration). Typically this suitename is in the form
                  `{targetDistribution}/XXXX` where XXXX is the bundle number.
* ***components***: The components defined in the bundle - typically autodetected
                    by apt-repos.
* ***architectures***: The architectures supported by the bundle - read from the
                       apt-repos configuration.
* ***publicKeys***: The public gpg-keys extracted from the TrustedGPG-Files referenced
                    by the apt-repos configuration of the bundles.

An example skeleton is:

    Name: {{ ruleName }}
    Method: {{ repoUrl }}
    Suite: {{ suite }}
    Components: {{ components }}
    Architectures: {{ architectures }} source
    DownloadListsAs: .gz
    GetInRelease: no
    VerifyRelease: {{ publicKeys }}


### bundle-base_updates.skel --> *updates/bundle-compose_dynamic.conf*

The skeleton `bundle-base_updates.skel` contains the definition of an update
rule that is also added to the file `repo/target/conf/updates/bundle-compose_dynamic.conf`.
In contrast to the previous skeleton, this skeleton ist added *for each base-suite* configured
for a target suite. A base suite could for example be a frozen version of an old
repository state - as it is for example used for so called "Point Releases". This
feature allows us to merge several base-suites together to one big repository.
Again, the skeleton is evaluated as a jinja2 template.

The list of base-suites for a target suite is read from the apt-repos
configuration contained in the `.apt-repos` folder (details below).

For each base-suite, the following variables are passed to the template engine:

* ***ruleName***: The reprepro identifier of the update rule as referred in the
                  variable `updates` (see target_distributions.skel)
* ***repoUrl***:  The repository URL of the base-suite (read from the apt-repos
                  configuration).
* ***suite***:    The suite name of the base-suite (read from the apt-repos
                  configuration).
* ***components***: The components defined in the base-suite - typically autodetected
                    by apt-repos.
* ***architectures***: The architectures supported by the base-suite - read from the
                       apt-repos configuration.
* ***targetDistribution***: The suite name of the target suite the bundle is selected
                            for. This suite typically differs from `suite`.
* ***publicKeys***: The public gpg-keys extracted from the TrustedGPG-Files referenced
                    by the apt-repos configuration of the base-suite.

An example skeleton is:

    Name: {{ ruleName }}
    Method: {{ repoUrl }}
    Suite: {{ suite }}
    Components: {{ components }}
    Architectures: {{ architectures }} source
    DownloadListsAs: .gz
    GetInRelease: no
    VerifyRelease: {{ publicKeys }}

An example for using the varibale `targetDistribution` could for example be the
usage of a blacklist of binary packages that should be ignored from the base-suite
during merge, adding the following line to the skeleton:

    FilterList: install FilterList.purge-from-{{ targetDistribution }}

To run this example, ensure that there's a blacklist file with the name `FilterList.purge-from-{targetDistribution}` with the following content:

    binary-package1 purge
    binary-package2 purge
    …
    binary-packageN purge

where *binary-package* are the names of real binary packages.


The apt-repos configuration in `.apt-repos`
===========================================

The reprepro-bundle tools expects an apt-repos configuration in the folder
`.apt-repos` of your *reprepro-managment* project. This way we are able
to describe all apt-repositories, their suites and other properties
that are important for managing our own distribution. This includes, in particular:

* suites from where we receive packages from (so called "supplier-suites"),
* the apt-repositories (and suites) created for our bundles,
* the target-repository (and suites) in which we combine sources and binary-packages
  to our own suite (so called "target-suites"),
* frozen versions of our distibution (which might e.g. be used as "reference-suites"),
* versions of our target-repository that contains just binary packages
* and other suites being used e.g. as mirrors as part of our rollout process.

Details about writing apt-repos configuration files can be found in
[the apt-repos Configuration.md document](https://github.com/lhm-limux/apt-repos/blob/master/docs/Configuration.md) and studying this document is highly recommended.

apt-repos defines two main ways of writing configuration files:

* Using the low level *.suites-files*
* Using the mor high level *.repos-files*

In the context of a *reprepro-managment* project it is recommended to describe
apt-repos suites using the high level form (*.repos-files*) - they provide more
features, such as autodetection of suites in a repository and their properties.

We use (apt-repos) *Tags* to set custom properties to physical apt-repos suites.
We for example add the tag "mybionic-supplier" to all suites that should be
used as "supplier-suites" for our distribution *mybionic*.

We use *Oid*s to share common properties between different suites and to write
shorter config files. This is done particularly for describing the very dynamic
bundle suites and their common properties.

Let's look at the details of writing apt-repos config files for the different types
of usage:


Defining default supplier-suites for `bundle edit`
--------------------------------------------------

Supplier suites can be defined in any *.repos* file within the `.apt-repos` folder
but it would be a good style to put supplier suites together to a file called
`.apt-repos/supplier.repos`.

The following example shows how such a configuration could look like for the ubuntu
upstream repository being used as supplier for the *mybionic* target suite:

    [
        "--------------------------------------------------------",
        {
          "Repository" : "Main Ubuntu Repository",
          "Prefix" : "ubuntu",
          "Url" : "http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/",
          "Suites" : [
              { "Suite" : "bionic", "Tags" : [ "mybionic-supplier" ] },
              { "Suite" : "bionic-backports", "Tags" : [] },
              { "Suite" : "bionic-proposed", "Tags" : [] },
              { "Suite" : "bionic-security", "Tags" : [ "mybionic-supplier" ] },
              { "Suite" : "bionic-updates", "Tags" : [ "mybionic-supplier" ] }
          ],
          "Architectures" : [ "i386", "amd64" ],
          "TrustedGPG" : "./gpg/ubuntu.gpg"
        },
        "--------------------------------------------------------"
    ]

In order for `bundle edit` to use these suites as **default supplier-suites**
it is recommended to add the tag `{distribution}-supplier` as shown in the
example. One could always adjust the list of supplier suites on the fly
using the parameter *--supplier-suites* and this parameter is by default set to
`{distribution}-supplier:,user-{user}:{distribution}`.

This default value shows that it is also possible to tag a suite with
`user-{user}:{distribution}`. In this case, `{user}` is replaced by the current
unix user name (calling `bundle edit`).


Defining bundle repositories for `bundle` and `bundle-compose`
--------------------------------------------------------------

Each bundle is a singular and independent apt-repository with one suite named
like the target-distribuion (e.g. `mybionic`).

Even though these bundles are independent, they share some common properties
and apt-repos allows us to define these common properties in one section inside
an `.apt-repos/bundle.repos` file. Again, the name doesn't matter but it is the
recommended one for bundles.

The following example shows how such a definition could look like in `bundle.repos`:

    [
       {
        "Repository" : "Bundle-Repositories for mybionic",
        "Oid" : "bundle-repositories-mybionic",
        "Prefix" : "bundle",
        "Tags" : [ "mybionic" ],
        "Codename" : "mybionic",
        "Url" : "http://repository-host/repo/bundle/",
        "Trusted" : true,
        "Architectures" : [ "i386", "amd64" ]
       }
    ]

This section defines the common properties of the bundles but it is not yet complete.
In order for apt-repos to find a concrete bundle such as *bundle:mybionic/0004*, we
need another file defining the single bundles itself.

This file also has to be available in `.apt-repos` and needs a name that follows
`bundle.repos` when sorting lexically. The file name `bundle_list.repos` would meet
this condition. The `bundle_list.repos` The subcommand `bundle update-repos-config`
is able to create and manage the content of such a file for us. This file e.g.
looks like this:

    [
     {
        "Oid": "bundle-repositories-mybionic",
        "Suites":
        ["--------",
        { "Suite": "mybionic/0001", "Url": "mybionic/0001", "Tags": [ "sealed" ] },
        { "Suite": "mybionic/0002", "Url": "mybionic/0002", "Tags": [ "sealed" ] },
        { "Suite": "mybionic/0003", "Url": "mybionic/0003", "Tags": [ "staging" ] },
        { "Suite": "mybionic/0004", "Url": "mybionic/0004", "Tags": [ "staging" ] },
        { "Suite": "mybionic/0005", "Url": "mybionic/0005", "Tags": [ "staging" ] },
        "---------"]
     }
    ]

The subcommand `bundle update-repos-config` writes this file to
`repo/bundle/bundle.repos`. It is common practice to symlink to that file from the
`.apt-repos` folder:

    cd .apt-repos
    ln -s ../repo/bundle/bundle.repos bundle_list.repos

The files *bundle.repos* and *bundle_list.repos* together define all properties
of the existing bundles. They are linked together via the common *Oid* which
is of the form `bundle-repositories-{targetDistribution}`.


Defining bundle-base suites for `bundle-compose` and reference suites for `bundle`
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the key features of `bundle-compose` is to merge *bundles* and *bundle-base*
suites together to a target suite which provides the packages of our own distribution.

To mark an apt-repos suite as **bundle-base**, just add an apt-repos **Tag with the name
`bundle-base.{targetDistribution}`** to the corresponding suite definition.

As an example, imagine that we already have created a frozen suite named *mybionic/1.0.0*
containing an old version of our target suite and we would like to use this "freeze"
as one base for our distribution. In this case the suite definition could look like this
example:

    [{
        "Repository" : "Freezes for MyOwnDistri",
        "Prefix" : "freeze",
        "Url" : "http://repository-host/repo/target/",
        "Suites" : [
            { "Suite" : "mybionic/1.0.0", "Tags" : [
                  "bundle-base.mybionic",
                  "mybionic-reference"
            ]}
        ],
        "Scan" : true,
        "DebSrc" : true,
        "TrustedGPG" : "gpg/trusted.gpg"
    }]

Ther's no recommendation in which `*.repos` file to put this definition. Just ensure
that you have got a definition somewhere in your `.apt-repos` folder.

In this example we mark the apt-repos suite *freeze:mybionic/1.0.0* as a bundle-base
for the distribution *mybionic*

This example also contains another important definition, the definition of a **reference-suite**.
The *reference-suite* is used by `bundle edit` to provide information about the packages
that are already known to our distribution. `bundle edit` compares all packages from
*supplier-suites* with the versions from the *reference-suites* and informs you in which
cases the packages are identical or upgradeable. A *reference-suite* is just **an apt-repos
Tag in the form `{targetDistribution}-reference`**.


Defining target suites for `bundle-compose apply`
-------------------------------------------------

The subcommand `bundle-compose apply` is the generator that generates config files
for `reprepro`. With this configuration `reprepro` is able to merge *bundles* and
*bundle-base* suites together to the **target suite**.

The definition of **target suites must be defined in form of
[Self-Contained repo_descriptions](https://github.com/lhm-limux/apt-repos/blob/master/docs/Configuration.md#self-contained-repo_descriptions)**!
This allows us to configure the parameters for target suites even if the target suites
don't yet exist physically. This is needed for bootstrapping a target repository from
scratch:

* In the first step there is just the self-contained target definition.
* In the second step ther's a `reprepro` configuration generated with the data from
  the target definition and
* in the last step there's a physical representation of the target suites
  after `reprepro update` was executed on the configuration.

In order to ensure that a target suite is recognized by `bundle-compose`, it
**must be marked with the apt-repos tag `bundle-compose-target`**. Only if this tag exists,
*bundle-compose* evaluates further details of the target suite. These details are
also expected in form of apt-repos tags. The following Tags should be used there:

* **`bundle-dist.{dist}`**: Defines that a target suite is able to recieve
  bundles created for the targetDistribution `{dist}`. Each target suite
  needs exactly one *bundle-dist* and a target suite without that definition would
  be skipped by `bundle-compose apply`.
* **`base-dist.{dist}`** (optional): With this tag it is possible to explicitly define
  a distribution `{dist}` that should be used as base-distribution. All base-suites
  tagged with the counterpart tag `bundle-base.{dist}` will then be merged into the
  target suite. If the target suite doesn't define the tag `base-dist.{dist}` explicitly,
  the *base-dist* is determined from the tag `bundle-dist.{dist}`.
  This means the *base-dist* might differ from the *bundle-dist*, e.g. to provide
  different base distributions for *standard*- and for *unattended*-targets.
* **`bundle-stage.{stage}`**: Defines that a target suite only recieves bundles
  whose bundle-status is mapped to the stage `{stage}`. Have a look at
  [bundle_status.py](../reprepro_bundle_compose/bundle_status.py) to see
  the current mapping. Here you can see for example that the *BundleStatus.PRODUCTION*
  is mapped to the stage *prod*. So if we add the tag `bundle-stage.prod`, we would
  recieve all bundles that are in *BundleStatus.PRODUCTION*.
* **`bundle-target.{target}`**: Each Bundle has assigned a Bundle Target in it's
  bundle metadata (see *info.once* file above). This Target allows us to define
  different target pools in which we want to put our bundles. Common targets are
  for example *standard* and *unattended*, but you can define your own targets if
  you want to. This tag defines, that our target suite should just recieve bundles
  for the target `{target}`.

*bundle-stage*- and *bundle-target* tags could be repeated within one suite definition multiple
times marking the suite to accept packages from multiple *stag(es)* or *target(s)*.

This is an example of a self-contained target definition using the above mentioned apt-repos tags:

    [{
        "Repository" : "MyBionic-Target Repository",
        "Prefix" : "target",
        "Tags" : [ "bundle-compose-target", "bundle-dist.mybionic" ],
        "Url" : "http://repository-host/repo/target/",
        "Suites" : [
            { "Suite" : "mybionic/dev", "Tags" : [
                "dev", "mybionic-reference",
                "bundle-stage.dev", "bundle-stage.smoketest", "bundle-stage.test", "bundle-stage.prod",
                "bundle-target.standard", "bundle-target.unattended"
            ]},
            { "Suite" : "mybionic/test", "Tags" : [
                "test",
                "bundle-stage.test", "bundle-stage.prod",
                "bundle-target.standard", "bundle-target.unattended"
            ]},
            { "Suite" : "mybionic", "Tags" : [
                "prod",
                "bundle-stage.prod",
                "bundle-target.standard", "bundle-target.unattended"
            ]},
            { "Suite" : "mybionic/unattended", "Tags" : [
                "prod",
                "bundle-stage.prod",
                "bundle-target.unattended"
            ]}
        ],
        "Scan" : false,
        "Architectures" : [ "i386", "amd64" ],
        "Components" : [ "main", "restricted", "universe", "multiverse", "partner" ],
        "DebSrc" : true,
        "Trusted" : true
    }]


Project specific "Point"-Files
==============================

It is also possible to add some "Point"-Files (Files in the form `.bundle-…` and
`.bundle-compose-…`) to the root of your *reprepro-management* project folder.
These files are there to configure some project specific settings for the tools
and their behaviour.

All these files consist of "key: value" pairs in the typical [syntax of debian
control files](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#syntax-of-control-files).


"Point"-Files for the `bundle`-tool
-----------------------------------

### `.bundle.hooks.conf`

In this file it is possible to define hooks (scripts that are called in a particular
situation) for the bundle tool. Here's an example:

    bundle_sealed: tools/send-sealed-notification-mail.sh {bundleName} {target} {subject}

These lines are in the following form: `{hook}: {executable-and-args}`, where
`{hook}` describes the situation (e.g. *bundle_sealed*) and
`{executable-and-args}` describes the script that is called in that situation
and their arguments. Each hook might provide variables. To reference a variable
please just write it's name wrapped in curly braces (as in the example above).

The *bundle*-tool currently only supports the hook:

* ***bundle_sealed***: It is called after a bundle was sealed using `bundle seal`.
  This hook was primarily introduced to inform the team about the existance
  of a new sealed bundle. In this hook, the following variables are available:

  * *bundleName*: The name of the bundle in the form `{distribution}/{bundleNumber}`.
  * *bundleSuiteName*: The name of the apt-repos suite of the bundle as it is defined
                       in the apt-repos config (above), typically in the form 
                       `bundle:{distribution}/{bundleNumber}`.
  * *target*: The value of the "Target:"-field from the bundle's info file.
  * *subject*: The first line of the (multiline) "Releasenotes:"-field from the
               bundle's info file.



"Point"-Files for the `bundle-compose`-tool
-------------------------------------------

### `.bundle-compose.hooks.conf`

In this file it is possible to define hooks (scripts that are called in a particular
situation) for the bundle-compose tool. Here's an example:

    pre_update_bundles: make update_bundle.repos

Like in `.bundle.hooks.conf`, these lines are in the following form: `{hook}: {executable-and-args}`. Please find more details above.

The *bundle-compose*-tool currently only supports the hook:

* ***pre_update_bundles***: It is called before `bundle-compose update-bundles` starts
                            it's main update task to prepare your *reprepro-management*
                            project for an update. It doesn't provide variables.


### `.bundle-compose.trac.conf`

This file describes settings for a trac ticket system with which we are able
to synchronize bundles during `bundle-compose update-bundles` or during
"Synchronize Bundle-Status" called from the `bundle-compose-app`.

An example configuration is:

    TracUrl: http://your-trac.host/your-trac-instance/
    CredentialType: trac
    CredentialHint: Add a hint here that is printed in the authentication dialog.
    UseParentTicketsFromInfoField: CausingTickets
    User: tracuser
    Password: tracuser's_Password

The key ***TracUrl*** describes the URL pointing to your trac instance. The protocol *XML-RPC* needs to be enabled within your trac instance and accessible by your trac user. Syncronization with trac is only enabled, if there is such a definition. Don't define that key if you need no trac synchronization.

If there is a key ***CredentialType*** defined, this causes bundle-compose to ask
for authentication data. If called from the `bundle-compose-app`, the provided
authentication data are stored in encrypted form in the running backend process.
If there are already known authentication data for the *CredentialType "trac"*,
the credentials will not be asked any more.

The key ***CredentialHint*** is optional and can be used for custom or translated
messages shown in the authentication dialog. In that message it is also possible to
refer to the variable `{TracUrl}` containing the content of the above's definition.

The key ***UseParentTicketsFromInfoField*** is optional and defines the name of a
field in the bundle's info file (yes, one could define custom fields in the
template `templates/bundle/{dist}/info.once`) that contains a space separated list
of Parent-Tickets referring to tickets in your ticket system.
A parent Ticket is typically the causing ticket that caused a developer to change
something on the system and that should be resolved by that bundle.
The key is evaluated by `bundle-compose update-bundles` if trac-synchronization
is enabled to synchronize the Parent-Tickets to trac. The key is also evaluated
by `bundle-compose jsondump` to add a key `parentTickets` for all bundles that
define the Field named `{UseParentTicketsFromInfoField}` in their bundle info files.

The key ***User*** is optional and only evaluated by the `./bundle-compose` command
line client (in the webfrontend we expect the user to interactively type in the
trac credentials). If `User` is provided, the command line client will use this
user name and not ask for it iteractively.

The key ***Password*** is optional and only evaluated by the `./bundle-compose` command
line client, too. You would typically not define this keyword on project level
(in the `.bundle-compose.trac.conf`) but in your user-private
`~/.config/bundle-compose/trac.conf` file. If this key is provided, this password
will be used and not be asked for interactively.


### `.bundle-compose.git-repos.conf`

This file describes the git server settings for accessing your *reprepro-managment*
project. It is read by the `bundle-compose-app` and is needed for the "Login".
When logging in, the *reprepro-managment* project is cloned from the provided
*RepoUrl* into a temporary directory. Everything you do in your "Session" is then
done in that temporary directory.

An example configuration is:

    RepoUrl: https://your-git-server/your-reprepro-management.git
    CredentialType: git
    CredentialHint: Add a hint here that is printed in the authentication dialog.

The key ***RepoUrl*** descibes the URL to your git server. For the authentication you
would typically use either *ssh* or *https://*-URLs. Note that with *ssh*-URLs it is
not possible to ask the users for Credentials at runtime - ssh is just supported with
a public key already registered at the ssh server. The `bundle-compose-app` only would
starts if there is a *RepoUrl* defined.

The keys ***CredentialType*** and ***CredentialHint*** are treated as described
by `.bundle-compos.trac.conf`.


Global Config Files for the `bundle-compose-app`
================================================

The following above mentioned point files can also be defined on global, user (private)
level outside of the project folder:

* .bundle-compose.git-repos.conf at **`$HOME/.config/bundle-compose/git-repo.conf`**
* .bundle-compose.trac.conf at **`$HOME/.config/bundle-compose/trac.conf`**

The content of these files will be merged together in a way that the settings
on user level override or enriches project specific settings. This could be
of use in the following scenarios:

To use the bundle-compose-app standalone
----------------------------------------

The project specific configuration above requires you to create a local clone
of your *reprepro-management* project **before** your are able to use
`bundle-compose` or the `bundle-compose-app`. In order for the tools to find
the project specific settings, the current working directory has to be the root
of your *reprepro-managment* project.

If you would like to run the `bundle-compose-app` without any local clone
or previously prepared context, it is possible to copy the content from the
above **`.bundle-compose.git-repos.conf`** into a local file in the user's home
at **`$HOME/.config/bundle-compose/git-repo.conf`**.

Now the `bundle-compose-app` can be started from everywhere (the current working
directory doesn't matter) and doesn't require you to clone your *reprepro-management*
project before using it - this is done during "Login".

To hide infos from your project
-------------------------------

Another use case for a global config file could be to override project specific
configuration settings or to add information that you don't want to store in
the project's git repository, e.g. the credential data for the trac user.
